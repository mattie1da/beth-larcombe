# Beth Larcombe's Portfolio 🐝

Welcome! My name is Matthew Wyatt ([mattie.world](https://mattie.world)), I built this project for Beth using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

## Getting Started 🚀

Once you have cloned this project locally, be sure you have installed the dependencies required to run this project.

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```

Now, you can spin up the application locally by entering the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

✨ Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the site locally.


## Data 🧑🏻‍💻

To add, remove, or update projects, amend the JSON dataset found in `lib/projects/data.json`.

For adding a new project, I recommend copy and pasting an existing object (to the bottom of the list) and amending it as per the spec of your new project.

ℹ️ Next.js will dynamically create pages at build time (it will use the slugs supplied in the "meta" property from the JSON).


## Deployed on Netlify (and Form/Emails) 🚚

This project is deployed and hosted on Netlify. The form in the footer utilises [Netlify's Form/Email notification system](https://docs.netlify.com/forms/setup/).
